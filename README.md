Created an AB test using R to understand what AB testing really is on a hypothetical marketing problem

The marketing department of an American based IT services provider has two versions for their home page

Version A: Contains home page with a thanksgiving promotion of $75 discount on apparels 
Version B: Contains home page with a black Friday promotion of 3 free games for play station 4 

The department conducted the test on both the versions A and B on random customers. This is the data that they gathered from the test, 8 customers out of 32 clicked on the thanksgiving promotion and 16 customers out of 32 clicked on black Friday promotion. The department now wants to know which version to implement. The finance department gives some details that version A will cost 100K to implement and version B will cost 400K to implement as free games needs to be bought. They also say giving out free games will generate revenue of 1000K.
